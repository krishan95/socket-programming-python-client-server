a simple client and server application.
As soon as a client signups, a seperate directory for client is created in root folder.

The client is able to->
1) upload a file
2) share file with another user
3) delete a file
4) download a file
5) open a file without downloading

( Their is no size restriction on file to be uploaded or downloaded)

The code to support all of these activities is present in the server.

Also three database files are created and used using sqlite.

Multi- threading is used for the pupose of providing multi-client support and semaphores are used to provide syncronization to the threads
while accesing db file.
( You can see createdb.py file to see the created db filesa and the tables present in the file)
